## General Information

- A bike-sharing service provider aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits. 
- The company wants to know: 
-- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
-- How well those variables describe the bike demands
- The purpose of this analyses is to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables so that it can be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. With this, they can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.
- The dataset was Boombikes sharing data provided by the upGrad. 

## Conclusions
The following variables are significant in predicting the demands for the bike sharing:
a. 'atemp',

b. 'windspeed',

c. 'year',

d. 'season',

e. 'mnth',

f. 'weathersit'.

The model explains about 82% of the total variance of bike sharing counts. I have observed similar r squared values in training and training sets, implying that the model is well generalized.
